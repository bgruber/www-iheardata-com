Brian Gruber is a software engineer who likes computers, music, and combinations thereof. He currently serves as the Principal Architect on the engineering team for [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com), where he's been helping people use the internet to get off the internet since 2011.

He particularly enjoys making musical noises out of data: sometimes with a practical purpose in mind; sometimes to make art; and sometimes just to see what it will sound like. As a consultant to multimedia artists, Brian has contributed to work that has been exhibited at Harvestworks, Eyebeam, the Chelsea Art Museum and the New York Hall of Science.

Brian graduated from Columbia University with a degree in computer engineering in 2003, and was a graduate student in music technology at NYU. He is a native of Queens, New York.
