      <description>Brian Gruber is a software engineer who likes computers, music, and combinations thereof. He currently serves as the Principal Architect on the engineering team for Meetup, where he&amp;rsquo;s been helping people use the internet to get off the internet since 2011.
He particularly enjoys making musical noises out of data: sometimes with a practical purpose in mind; sometimes to make art; and sometimes just to see what it will sound like.</description>
